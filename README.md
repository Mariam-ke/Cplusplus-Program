# Math Based Cplusplus-Program

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
<p>The project was in module 6 and it was about creating a program that has three features.
Feature are:
1.	Multiply a digit entered by the user
2.	Double a digit entered by a user
3.	Exit the program</p>
<br>

### What did you do particularly well? 
<p>I am fairly new to switch cases, however I think after a bit of trial and error I managed to get the switch cases work and created a case of each feature to work.</p>
<br>

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
<p>One of the ways I would enhance the code would be to write a test for the code to make sure on function ability. Another way would be to better document and comments the code</p>
<br>

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
<p>For this program I had an issue with the test cases even though I have used them before so this made it very confusing to figure out because the code seemed okay but I had about 10 bugs. I googled one of the error messages and came across different methods on stack overflow on how to solve the issue and after experimenting for a while the one that worked was to individually add curly braces before each switch case.</p>
<br>

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
<p>The major skill I learnt from this project was to collaborate between C++ and Python, Seems like there is more than one way to do it depending on the OS you are using. People using linux call the libraries differently from Mac and Windows users. I now feel fairly comfortable writing on windows but would like to experiment more on a Mac or linux machine as that seems to be a bit more complex.</p>
<br>

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
<p>I tried to add in comments as much as I could for the steps I was running. I also tried to group the code in blocks for each task and have descriptive names for all variables to make it easy to understand and read.</p>
